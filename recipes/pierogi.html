    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pierogi look similar to Potstickers but are filled with a potato and cheese filling and are made from a simple egg
    dough. These are dreamy creamy dumpling that is guaranteed to hit the spot. These pierogis are the ultimate comfort
    food. The dough is a non-yeasted dough that is super easy to work with. It rolls out like a dream. Traditionally these
    potato and cheese dumplings are made with farmerâ€™s cheese which can be hard to find. Cottage cheese and sour cream make
    a great substitution.</p>
    <p>The combination of boiling and then pan-frying the pierogi provides the perfect texture. These are perfectly tender with
    a slightly crispy outside. The inside contains a cheesy luscious filling you are going to love. These are way better
    than anything you will find in the frozen section of the store. The caramelized onions and butter are absolutely divine.
    Top these pierogi with a bit more cheese and green onions if desired.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>5 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup butter, softened</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>5 ounces cream cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon pepper</li>
        <li>4 medium potatoes, peeled and cubed</li>
        <li>2 medium onions, chopped</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped onion</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon butter</li>
        <li>Minced fresh parsley</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a food processor, combine flour and salt; cover and pulse to blend. Add water, eggs and butter; cover and pulse until
        dough forms a ball, adding an additional 1 to 2 tablespoons of water or flour if needed. Let rest, covered, 15 to 30
        minutes.</li>
        <li>Place potatoes in a large saucepan and cover with water. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat; cover and simmer
        until tender, 10-15 minutes. Meanwhile, in a large skillet over medium-high heat, saute onions in butter until tender.</li>
        <li>Drain potatoes. Over very low heat, stir potatoes until steam has evaporated, 1-2 minutes. Press through a potato ricer
        or strainer into a large bowl. Stir in cream cheese, salt, pepper and onion mixture.</li>
        <li>Divide dough into 4 parts. On a lightly floured surface, roll 1 portion of dough to 1/8-in. thickness; cut with a
        floured 3-in. biscuit cutter. Place 2 teaspoons of filling in center of each circle. Moisten edges with water; fold in
        half and press edges to seal. Repeat with remaining dough and filling.</li>
        <li>Bring a Dutch oven of water to a boil over high heat; add pierogi in batches. Reduce heat to a gentle simmer; cook until
        pierogi float to the top and are tender, 1-2 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon. In a large skillet, saute 4 pierogi
        and onion in butter until pierogi are lightly browned and heated through; sprinkle with parsley. Repeat with remaining
        pierogi.</li>
