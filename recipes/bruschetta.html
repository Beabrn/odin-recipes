    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Bruschetta is simple, yet so delicious. It is one of those recipes that can only be as good as the ingredients used. Sub
    par tomatoes, low-quality olive oil, and mediocre bread is just not going to cut it for a truly authentic Italian
    bruschetta. We hate to admit that we get a little possessive over our bruschetta. Sharing is one of those skills we are
    still working on when it comes to our favorite foods, especially when they are as fresh and perfectly crunchy as this!
    Please don’t judge us too harshly. You’ll understand once you’ve tried it. This bruschetta is life changing.</p>
    <p>Perfectly ripe tomatoes will make this recipe even better! To find the perfect tomatoes look for heavy tomatoes with a
    smooth skin. You want it to be plump and free of any big blemishes, bruises, or bug bites. You want to choose a
    high-quality vine ripened tomato, so it can have as much flavor as possible. For Americans, try purchasing the tomatoes
    that are sold on the vine in the grocery store. You can also try heirloom varieties which can yield both colorful and
    delicious results.</p>
